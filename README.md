# SRE-Calculator
This is a simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations. It takes two numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and power operations. The program also includes a quit option to exit the program.

The code is well-structured and easy to understand. It uses a while loop to continuously prompt the user for a choice and perform the corresponding operation. The user can enter a choice from 1 to 6, and the program will execute the corresponding operation and display the result.

To add documentation to this code, you can use docstrings to provide information about the code input parameters and return types. For example, you can add docstrings to the functions that perform the arithmetic operations to explain what parameters they take and what type of output they return.
